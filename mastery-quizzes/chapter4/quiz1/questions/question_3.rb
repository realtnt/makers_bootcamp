# Write a program that:
# * Calculates the "FizzBuzz sequence" from 1 to 20.
#   * For each integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
#     * If the number is divisible by 3, replace the number with `Fizz`.
#     * If the number is divisible by 5, replace the number with `Buzz`
#     * If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the number with
#       `FizzBuzz`.
#     * If the number is divisible by neither 3 or 5, keep the number.
# * `puts`es these "FizzBuzz sequence" entries, one per line.

(1..20).each do |i|
  if i % 15 == 0
    puts "FizzBuzz"
  elsif i % 5 == 0
    puts "Buzz"
  elsif i % 3 == 0
    puts "Fizz"
  else
    puts i
  end
end

# The expected output when you execute the program is:
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7
# 8
# Fizz
# Buzz
# 11
# Fizz
# 13
# 14
# FizzBuzz
# 16
# 17
# Fizz
# 19
# Buzz
