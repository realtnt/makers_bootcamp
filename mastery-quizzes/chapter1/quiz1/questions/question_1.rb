# This first challenge is intended to get you into the flow of retrieving,
# solving and submitting quizzes
#
# Don't over think it, but do make sure you run the tests and that they pass
#
# To run the tests,
# - make sure you're in the `chapter1/quiz1` directory
# - then enter `rspec` and hit return
# - if you see "0 examples, 0 failures", you're in the wrong directory! :)
#
# Now, write a program that uses `puts` to print any integer

puts 1
