# Uncomment each line and fill in the blanks so that the arithmetic
# operations produce the correct value for each variable.
# e.g. in `four = 2.+()`, the calculation to the right of the `=` should
# evaluate to 4. So it would become `four = 2.+(2)`


# TIP: remember that `+` is a method which can be used with 'dot syntax', as below, or with a space as in `2 + 2`
five = 2.+(3)

seven = 14./(2)

two = 2.*(1)./(1)

three_point_zero = 6.to_f./(2)

two_is_integer = 4.to_f./(2).to_i.integer?

# TIP: remember that the `%` sign is modulo and it gives the remainder after division.  So, for example `one = 3 % 2` and, also, `one = 5 % 2`
four = 12.%(8)

zero = 12.%(2)
